## About

Successfully completed “Web-developer” course at Yandex Practicum. Currently work on self-projects and small projects for customers as a freelancer. At the same time solve programming exercises on codewars.com (5 kyu). I’m good at self-management and also construct long-term non-toxic mutual relations in small groups of people.
My dream is to work on an inspirational project in a small well-coordinated team. 

My next future plan is to learn TypeScript and state managers such as Redux or Mobx.

## Code example

**Codewars task:** write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

```
function humanReadable(seconds) {
  const sec = seconds % 60;
  let min = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const hour = Math.floor(min / 60);

  if (seconds >= 3600) {
    min = Math.floor(seconds / 60) % 60;
  }

  return [
    hour.toString().length === 1 ? '0' + hour : hour,
    min.toString().length === 1 ? '0' + min : min,
    sec.toString().length === 1 ? '0' + sec : sec,
  ].join(':');
}
```
